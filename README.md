### **Singleton pattern:**
The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created throughout the application's lifecycle. This instance is globally accessible and provides a centralized point of control.

**Key Features:**

✅ Single Instance – Restricts instantiation to just one object. </br>
✅ Global Access – The instance is accessible from anywhere in the application. </br>
✅ Thread Safety – Ensures that multiple threads do not create multiple instances. </br>
✅ Efficient Resource Management – Prevents unnecessary memory usage and redundant object creation. </br>

### **Repository Pattern**:
✅ It separates the data access logic from the business logic within the application, ensuring a clean architecture. </br>
✅ It promotes loose coupling, making it easier to test the application components independently. </br>
✅ It simplifies maintenance. If a new method is required in the future, it can easily be added to the repository, implemented once, and then reused across the application. </br>
✅ Business logic is decoupled from the data access layer, so changes in the underlying database or data source won't impact the business logic. </br>
✅ Error handling and logging for all database operations can be centralized within the repository, ensuring consistency and ease of debugging. </br>

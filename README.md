**Singleton pattern:**
The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created throughout the application's lifecycle. This instance is globally accessible and provides a centralized point of control.

**Key Features:**

✅ Single Instance – Restricts instantiation to just one object. </br>
✅ Global Access – The instance is accessible from anywhere in the application. </br>
✅ Thread Safety – Ensures that multiple threads do not create multiple instances. </br>
✅ Efficient Resource Management – Prevents unnecessary memory usage and redundant object creation. </br>

### **Singleton pattern:**
The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created throughout the application's lifecycle. This instance is globally accessible and provides a centralized point of control.

**Key Features:**

✅ Single Instance – Restricts instantiation to just one object. </br>
✅ Global Access – The instance is accessible from anywhere in the application. </br>
✅ Thread Safety – Ensures that multiple threads do not create multiple instances. </br>
✅ Efficient Resource Management – Prevents unnecessary memory usage and redundant object creation. </br>

### **Singleton pattern With Lazy Loading :**
✅ Benefits of Using Lazy Loading with Lazy<T>: </br>
✅ Improved Performance: The instance is created only when needed. </br>
✅Built-in Thread-Safety: No need for manual lock handling. </br>

### **Repository Pattern**:
✅ It separates the data access logic from the business logic within the application, ensuring a clean architecture. </br>
✅ It promotes loose coupling, making it easier to test the application components independently. </br>
✅ It simplifies maintenance. If a new method is required in the future, it can easily be added to the repository, implemented once, and then reused across the application. </br>
✅ Business logic is decoupled from the data access layer, so changes in the underlying database or data source won't impact the business logic. </br>
✅ Error handling and logging for all database operations can be centralized within the repository, ensuring consistency and ease of debugging. </br>

### **factory Pattern**:
✅ It centralizes the object creation logic in a single place, ensuring consistency and reducing duplication. </br>
✅ The client specifies the type, and the factory creates and returns the appropriate instance. </br>
✅ It simplifies future maintenance—when new subtypes are introduced, updates are only needed in the factory class. </br>
✅ It promotes loose coupling by decoupling the client code from the concrete implementation of objects. </br>

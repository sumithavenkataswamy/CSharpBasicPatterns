Singleton pattern:
The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created throughout the application's lifecycle. This instance is globally accessible and provides a centralized point of control.

Key Features:
✅ Single Instance – Restricts instantiation to just one object.
✅ Global Access – The instance is accessible from anywhere in the application.
✅ Thread Safety – Ensures that multiple threads do not create multiple instances.
✅ Efficient Resource Management – Prevents unnecessary memory usage and redundant object creation.
